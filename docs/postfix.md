### VapourSynth Expr Syntax Documentation

`llvmexpr` provides two powerful VapourSynth functions that evaluate mathematical or logical expressions: `Expr` and `SingleExpr`. Their core is the `expr` string, which uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). This guide details the syntax of that string, highlighting the differences between the two functions.

---

### **1. Core Concepts & Execution Models**

#### **1.1. `Expr`: Per-Pixel Execution**

`Expr` is the traditional function. It processes a clip pixel-by-pixel. The provided RPN expression is executed once for *every single pixel* of the output frame. This makes it ideal for standard image filtering, such as applying a brightness curve, combining clips, or spatial filtering.

- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Operates on a "current pixel" concept, with `X` and `Y` coordinates available.
    - Can have different expressions for each color plane.
    - The final value on the stack is implicitly written to the current pixel's location.

#### **1.2. `SingleExpr`: Per-Frame Execution**

`SingleExpr` is a specialized variant where the RPN expression is executed only *once for the entire frame*. This model is not suitable for general image processing but excels at tasks that require summarizing or distributing data across a frame.

- **Key Characteristics:**
    - No "current pixel" concept; `X` and `Y` are unavailable.
    - A single expression is used for all planes.
    - All output must be done explicitly by writing to absolute pixel coordinates or by writing to frame properties.
    - The stack must be empty at the end of execution.

> **Note:** Throughout this document, features specific to one function will be explicitly marked. If not marked, the feature is available in both `Expr` and `SingleExpr`.

#### **1.3. Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**

Instead of the conventional `A + B`, RPN places operators _after_ their operands: `A B +`. The expression is evaluated using a stack. Values are pushed onto the stack, and operators pop values, perform a calculation, and push the result back onto the stack.

- **Example:** To calculate `(5 + 3) * 2`, the RPN expression is `5 3 + 2 *`.
  1.  `5`: Push 5. Stack: `[5]`
  2.  `3`: Push 3. Stack: `[5, 3]`
  3.  `+`: Pop 3 and 5, calculate 8, push 8. Stack: `[8]`
  4.  `2`: Push 2. Stack: `[8, 2]`
  5.  `*`: Pop 2 and 8, calculate 16, push 16. Stack: `[16]`

In `Expr`, the final value on the stack is the result for the pixel. In `SingleExpr`, the stack must be empty after execution.

#### **1.4. Data Ranges**

`Expr` does not normalize input clip values. You must account for the native range of the pixel format.

- **8-bit integer:** 0 to 255
- **10-bit integer:** 0 to 1023
- **16-bit integer:** 0 to 65535
- **32-bit float:** Typically 0.0 to 1.0 for Luma (Y) and Alpha, and -0.5 to 0.5 for Chroma (U/V).

When mixing formats, scale values accordingly. For example, to add an 8-bit value to a 10-bit value, you might use `x y 4 * +` (multiplying the 8-bit value `y` by 4 to scale it to the 10-bit range).

When a non-integer result is writing to an integer pixel, it will be rounded to the nearest even integer.

### **2. Operands: Pushing Values onto the Stack**

#### **2.1. Clip Identifiers**

Input clips are the primary source of pixel values. They can be referenced in two ways:

- **By Letter (up to 26 clips):**
  - `x`: The first input clip.
  - `y`: The second input clip.
  - `z`: The third input clip.
  - `a` to `w`: The 4th to 26th clips.

- **By Index (arbitrary number of clips):**
  - `srcN`: Accesses the N-th input clip (0-indexed).
  - `src0` is equivalent to `x`.
  - `src1` is equivalent to `y`.
  - `src26` accesses the 27th clip.

#### **2.2. Numeric Constants**

Literals are pushed directly onto the stack. The decimal separator for floating-point numbers is always a period (`.`), regardless of the system's locale settings.

- **Standard:** `128`, `3.14`, `-0.5`
- **Hexadecimal:** `0x10` (16), `0xFF` (255).
- **Octal:** `010` (8). Note that invalid octal numbers like `09` are parsed as floats (`9.0`).

**Example:** `x 128 -` (In `Expr`, this subtracts 128 from each pixel value of the first clip).

#### **2.3. Special Constants & Coordinates**

These operators push a specific value onto the stack without needing an operand.

- `pi`: The mathematical constant Ï€ (approximately 3.14159).
- `N`: The current frame number.
- `width`: The width of the frame (of the current plane in `Expr`, or the container/luma plane in `SingleExpr`).
- `height`: The height of the frame (of the current plane in `Expr`, or the container/luma plane in `SingleExpr`).
- `width^plane_no`: (**SingleExpr only**) The width of the specified plane (`plane_no` is an integer, e.g., `width^0`). This is useful for formats with subsampled chroma.
- `height^plane_no`: (**SingleExpr only**) The height of the specified plane (e.g., `height^1`). This is useful for formats with subsampled chroma.
- `X`: (**Expr only**) The current pixel's column coordinate.
- `Y`: (**Expr only**) The current pixel's row coordinate.

#### **3.4. Conditional Operator**

- `?`: A ternary operator. `C A B ?` is equivalent to `C > 0 ? A : B`. If `C` is greater than 0, `A` is evaluated and its result is pushed. Otherwise, `B` is evaluated and its result is pushed.
  - **Example:** `x 128 > x 0 ?` (If the pixel value is greater than 128, keep it, otherwise set it to 0). This is an `Expr` example.

| `bitnot` | Bitwise NOT |

---

### **4. Advanced Operations**

#### **4.1. Stack Manipulation**

| Operator | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dup` | (1 operand) Duplicates the top item. | `x dup *` is equivalent to `x 2 pow`. |
| `swap` | (2 operands) Swaps the top two items. | `x y swap -` is equivalent to `y x -`. |
| `dupN` | Duplicates the item N positions from the top. `dup0` is `dup`. | |
| `swapN` | Swaps the top item with the item N positions down. `swap1` is `swap`. | |
| `drop` / `dropN` | Drops the top N items. `drop` is an alias for `drop1`. | `1 2 3 drop2` results in a stack of `[1]`. |
| `sortN` | Sorts the top N items, with the smallest value ending up on top. | `3 1 2 sort3` results in a stack of `[3, 2, 1]`. |

#### **4.2. Named Variables**

- `var!`: Pops the top value from the stack and stores it in a variable named `var`.
- `var@`: Pushes the value of the variable `var` onto the stack.

**Variable Initialization:** Variables are allocated when the expression is compiled, but they are **not** automatically initialized to any value. It is your responsibility to store a value into a variable (`!`) before you load from it (`@`).

The compiler performs a rigorous static analysis of the control flow. If it detects any path where a variable could be read before it is guaranteed to have been written to, it will raise an error and refuse to compile the expression. This prevents the use of uninitialized variables.

**Example:** `x 2 / my_var! my_var@ my_var@ *` (In `Expr`, this calculates `(x/2)^2`).

#### **4.3. Data Access & Output**

Both `Expr` and `SingleExpr` can read pixel data and frame properties. However, their methods and capabilities differ significantly due to their execution models.

##### **4.3.1. Pixel Access (`Expr` only)**

In `Expr`, you can access pixels from any clip at absolute or relative coordinates.

- **Relative Access:** `clip[relX, relY]:[mode]`
  - Accesses a pixel relative to the current coordinate (`X`, `Y`). `relX` and `relY` must be integer constants.
  - **Example:** `y[-1, 0]` accesses the pixel to the immediate left in the second clip (`y`).
  - **Boundary Suffixes:** If no suffix is provided, the edge behavior is determined by the filter's global `boundary` parameter.
    - `:c`: Forces clamped boundary (edge pixels are repeated).
    - `:m`: Forces mirrored boundary.

- **Absolute Access:** `absX absY clip[]:[mode]`
  - Accesses a pixel at an absolute coordinate. It pops `absY` then `absX` from the stack. These coordinates can be computed by expressions.
  - If the coordinates are not integers, they will be rounded half to even.
  - **Example:** `X 2 / Y x[]` reads the pixel at half the current X coordinate from the first clip, using the default clamp mode.
  - **Boundary Suffixes:**
    - `:c`: Forces clamped boundary. **This is the default if no suffix is specified.**
    - `:m`: Forces mirrored boundary.
    - `:b`: Uses the behavior from the filter's global `boundary` parameter.
  - **Warning:** Absolute access may not be vectorized by the JIT compiler if coordinates are computed at runtime, which can cause severe performance degradation. Use relative access with constant offsets where possible.

##### **4.3.2. Pixel & Data I/O (`SingleExpr` only)**

Since `SingleExpr` has no concept of a "current pixel," all data I/O must be explicit and use absolute coordinates.

- **Absolute Pixel Reading:** `absX absY clip^plane []`
  - A new token `clip^plane` is used to specify both the clip and the plane index (`0` for Y, `1` for U, `2` for V, etc.).
  - The `[]` operator then pops `absY` and `absX` from the stack and pushes the pixel value from the specified location. If the coordinates are floating-point values, they are rounded to the nearest integer (with ties to even).
  - **Boundary Handling:** The boundary behavior is controlled by the filter's global `boundary` parameter, which can be set to clamp (0, default) or mirror (1).
  - **Example:** `100 200 src0^0 []` reads the pixel at coordinate (100, 200) from the first clip's (`src0`) luma plane (`^0`) and pushes it onto the stack.

- **Absolute Pixel Writing:** `value absX absY @[]^plane`
  - This is the primary way to modify the output frame in `SingleExpr`.
  - The operator is suffixed with the target plane index (`^plane`). It pops a `value`, `absX` coordinate, and `absY` coordinate from the stack and writes the value to that location in the output frame's specified plane. If the coordinates are floating-point values, they are rounded to the nearest integer (with ties to even).
  - **Boundary Handling Warning:** Pixel writes perform **no boundary checking**. Writing to coordinates outside the valid frame dimensions (e.g., `[-1, -1]` or `[width, height]`) is a memory error. This leads to **undefined behavior** and can crash the process, corrupt the output frame, or cause other unpredictable issues. It is the expression author's responsibility to ensure all write coordinates are within the valid `[0, width-1]` and `[0, height-1]` range for each plane.
  - **Example:** `255 0 0 @[]^0` writes the value `255` to the top-left pixel (0, 0) of the first plane.
  - **Important:** If a pixel is not explicitly written to, its value is copied from the first input clip (`src0`).

##### **4.3.3. Frame Property Access**

- **Reading (Both `Expr` and `SingleExpr`):** `clip.PropertyName`
  - Loads a scalar numerical frame property. `clip` can be any clip identifier (`x`, `y`, `srcN`, etc.).
  - **Example:** `x.PlaneStatsAverage` pushes the value of the `PlaneStatsAverage` property from the first clip's frame properties.
  - If the property is not a scalar numerical property, its value will be its first byte.
  - If the property does not exist, its value will be `NaN` (Not a Number).

- **Writing (`SingleExpr` only):** `value prop_name$`
  - The `$` operator, suffixed with a property name, writes a value to that frame property on the output frame.
  - It pops one value from the stack and assigns it to the property `prop_name`.
  - If the property already exists, it is overwritten. This is useful for calculating and passing metadata.
  - **Atomicity:** Property writes are atomic. A subsequent read within the same expression will see the newly written value.
  - **Example:** `x.PlaneStatsMax 2 / MyNewProp$` reads `PlaneStatsMax` from clip `x`, divides it by 2, and writes the result to a new property named `MyNewProp`.

#### **4.4. `Expr`-Specific Output Control**

These operators provide fine-grained control over the default per-pixel output behavior in `Expr`. They are not available in `SingleExpr`.

| Operator | Operands | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `@[]` | 3 | `val absX absY @[]` pops a value `val` and two coordinates `absX`, `absY`, and writes `val` to the output pixel at `[absX, absY]` *in the current plane*. This allows an expression for one pixel to write to another. If the coordinates are not integers, they will be truncated to integers. |
| `^exit^` | 0 | Pushes a special marker value onto the stack. If, after the entire `Expr` expression is evaluated for a pixel, this marker is the *only* item remaining on the stack, the default write to the current pixel `[X, Y]` is suppressed. This is useful in expressions that only use `@[]` to write to other pixels. |

**Stack Requirements at Exit:**
- **`Expr`:** The stack must contain exactly one value, which becomes the output for the current pixel. Alternatively, it can contain only the `^exit^` marker to suppress output.
- **`SingleExpr`:** The stack must be **empty** at the end of execution. Any leftover values will result in an error.

**Undefined Behavior Warning (`Expr`):**

The behavior of memory writes in `Expr` is undefined under the following conditions:
- If a pixel receives more than one write from any source (default write or `@[]`) during the processing of a single frame.
- If a pixel is not written to at all (and `^exit^` was not used).

For example, an expression like `val x y @[] ^exit^` is valid: it writes `val` to `[x, y]` and then suppresses the default write. An expression like `val x y @[]` is **invalid** because it leaves the stack empty; it should be `val x y @[] ^exit^` to be valid if no default write is desired. If a default write is also desired, one could do `val x y @[] some_other_val`.

### **5. Control Flow (Turing-Complete Operations)**

The RPN engine is Turing-complete, allowing for arbitrary loops and conditional branching using labels and jumps. This enables complex iterative algorithms directly within an expression.

**Warning:** With great power comes great responsibility. An infinite loop in your expression will cause the filter to hang indefinitely.

#### **5.1. Labels**

-   `#label_name`: Defines a jump destination. The `#` must be the first character of the token. `label_name` can be any string of characters without whitespace. The label definition itself is a no-op during execution; it only marks a position for jumps to target.

#### **5.2. Conditional Jumps**

-   `label_name#`: Performs a conditional jump. The `#` must be the last character of the token.
    -   It pops the top value from the stack.
    -   If the value is greater than `0` (true), execution jumps to the corresponding `#label_name` and continues from the instruction immediately following the label.
    -   If the value is `0` or less (false), execution ignores the jump and continues with the next instruction in the expression.

#### **5.3. Example: Power Calculation via Loop**

The following expression calculates `x` to the power of 4, equivalent to `x 4 pow`, but demonstrates a loop using variables.

**Expression:** `x base! 1 result! 4 counter! #loop result@ base@ * result! counter@ 1 - counter! counter@ loop# result@`

**Execution Trace:**

1.  **Pre-initialization (automatic):**
    -   All variables (`base`, `result`, `counter`) are automatically allocated and initialized to `0.0`.

2.  **Initialization:**
    -   `x base!`: Stores the pixel value of clip `x` into the variable `base`.
    -   `1 result!`: Initializes `result` to 1.
    -   `4 counter!`: Initializes a loop `counter` to 4.
    -   Stack is now empty.

3.  **Loop Start (`#loop`):**
    -   `result@ base@ * result!`: `result` becomes `result * base`.
    -   `counter@ 1 - counter!`: Decrements the `counter`.
    -   `counter@`: Pushes the current value of `counter` onto the stack.
    -   `loop#`: Pops `counter`.
        -   If `counter` was > 0, execution jumps back to `#loop`.
        -   If `counter` was 0, the jump is not taken.

4.  **Termination:**
    -   After the loop finishes (when `counter` reaches 0), the expression continues.
    -   `result@`: The final calculated value is pushed onto the stack, becoming the output for the pixel.
